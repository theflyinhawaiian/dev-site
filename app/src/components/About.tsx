      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>From when I was a kid, I've always had an unending curiosity for how things worked. From playing with CSS on Nickelodeon.com and my MySpace profile, to setting up Minecraft servers, to jailbreaking my iPhone, the signs were always there that I'd grow into the inquisitive engineer that I am today.</p>
      <p>I greatly enjoy solving challenging problems and am particularly fascinated by the intersection of software and human experience, from both UX and engineering perspectives. I have an unquenchable thirst for learning new patterns, technologies, and frameworks, and I enjoy sharing that knowledge with others.</p>
    </div>
